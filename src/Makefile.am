# 1. Programs using the previous version may use the new version as drop-in replacement,
#    and programs using the new version can also work with the previous one.
#    In other words, no recompiling nor relinking is needed.
#    In this case, bump revision only, don’t touch current nor age.
# 2. Programs using the previous version may use the new version as drop-in replacement,
#    but programs using the new version may use APIs not present in the previous one.
#    In other words, a program linking against the new version may fail with “unresolved symbols”
#    if linking against the old version at runtime: set revision to 0, bump current and age.
# 3. Programs may need to be changed, recompiled, and relinked in order to use the new version.
#    Bump current, set revision and age to 0.
