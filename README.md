Building
--------

`protobuf2json-c` requires a C compiler, [protobuf-c][] and [jansson][] to be installed.
If building from a git checkout, the `autotools` (`autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`) must also be installed,
and the build system must be generated by running the `autogen.sh` script:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install
